IMPLEMENTATION NOTES – RADIOSONDE DECODING
======================================================================

This project implements an original radiosonde decoding pipeline based on
publicly available technical information, signal analysis, and independent
reverse-engineering work.

No third-party radiosonde decoding source code has been copied, linked, or
derived. All decoding logic, frame parsing, data handling, and protocol
processing have been implemented independently by the author and some
contributors.

This software is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or derived from any
radiosonde manufacturer or third-party decoder project.

======================================================================
REFERENCES
======================================================================

Protocol understanding and decoding concepts are based on publicly available
documentation and community technical resources, including but not limited to:

- https://github.com/bazjo/RS41_Decoding
- Vaisala RS41 public user documentation
- General digital communication textbooks, academic papers, and publicly
  available SDR and radio-amateur community resource

These references are provided for attribution and transparency only and do not
imply inclusion of third-party source code.
